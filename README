CleverDNS - Server recursor code
install instructions.

This is made thinking on Ubuntu Server. but the process its similar in every Posix like system

pre-install: 
you could do this via aptitude or apt-get :)

-pdns-server
-pdns-backend-pipe
-libyaml-tiny-perl 
-libnetaddr-ip-perl
-libnet-dns-perl

install CleverDNS:
you have already the code? if not use git to get all the code of CleverDns

bash$ cd /etc/powedns/
bash:/etc/powerdns$ mkdir /etc/powerdns/cleverdns
bash:/etc/powerdns$ cd cleverdns
bash:/etc/powerdns/cleverdns$git clone git://github.com/gagoar/CleverDNS.git .

 or 
go to http://github.com/gagoar/CleverDNS/tree/source and hit Download Source,  ask if you want tar or zip (you know how it goes)

you will need configurate pdns.conf in order to run as server.

copy the next configuracion in /etc/powerdns/pdns.conf

post-install:
you have to edit /etc/default/pdns.conf and change START=no with START=yes

in Cleverdns you have a file with important information: global.conf
here you can change: Where is store the local domains,  nameserver to ask for external domains and port if it's different than 53.
if you dont use this 2 vars and let it blank. Cleverdns will use /etc/resolv.conf to ask.

running server:
bash$ service pdns start

NOTE: to find it out if cleverdns its working properly... you can do (in ubuntu):
bash$ service pdns monitor 
and it will run in monitor mode,  you will see all the request of the clients hiting CleverDNS and CleverDNS answering back in each case.

enjoy this code. let me know if I can help.
